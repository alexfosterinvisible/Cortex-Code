THIS DIRECTORY IS A PYTHON PACKAGE
===================================

What makes it installable via `uv add` or `pip install`?

→ The presence of `pyproject.toml` with [project] and [build-system] sections.

That's it. Any directory with these becomes `uv add`-able:

    pyproject.toml          ← REQUIRED: defines package name, version, deps
    ├── [project]           ← Package metadata
    ├── [build-system]      ← How to build (hatchling, setuptools, flit)
    └── [project.scripts]   ← CLI entry points (optional)

To use this package from another project:

    # Option 1: Absolute path
    uv add /Users/dev3/code4b/adw-framework

    # Option 2: Relative path  
    uv add ../adw-framework

This creates in your pyproject.toml:

    [tool.uv.sources]
    adw-framework = { path = "/Users/dev3/code4b/adw-framework" }

Then `uv sync` installs it into your .venv.

Package vs Module vs Installable Package:

    Module              = Single .py file
    Package             = Directory with __init__.py
    Installable Package = Directory with pyproject.toml + [project]

This is an INSTALLABLE PACKAGE containing two PACKAGES:
    - adw/       (Python code)
    - commands/  (Claude command templates)
