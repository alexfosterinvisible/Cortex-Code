# n-skills Marketplace Overview

**n-skills** is a curated marketplace for AI coding agent skills, created by Numman Ali. The platform establishes universal standards for skill distribution across diverse AI agents.

## Core Philosophy

The project operates on the principle: **"Write once. Run everywhere."** It addresses the fragmentation problem where different AI agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, etc.) each maintain separate skill formats and installation systems.

## Universal Standards

n-skills promotes three key standards:

1. **SKILL.md** — Universal skill format
2. **AGENTS.md** — Universal discovery file (now adopted by 20,000+ repositories)
3. **openskills** — Universal installer compatible with all major agents

## Available Skills

Currently featured skills include:

- **dev-browser** (automation) — Persistent page state browser automation
- **gastown** (tools) — Multi-agent orchestrator optimized for Claude Code
- **zai-cli** (tools) — Vision, search, and GitHub exploration capabilities

## Curation Standards

Submissions must demonstrate:
- Genuine problem-solving capability
- Clean, well-documented implementation
- Practical developer value
- Active maintenance commitments

The marketplace explicitly rejects low-effort wrappers, abandoned projects, and submissions lacking substantive utility.

## Technical Implementation

External skills sync automatically from upstream repositories daily via GitHub Actions, preserving source attribution while maintaining centralized curation.
