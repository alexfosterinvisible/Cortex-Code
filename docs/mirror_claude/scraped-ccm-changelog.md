# Complete Changelog Content

I've reviewed the webpage content provided. This is a CHANGELOG file documenting version history for what appears to be a Claude Code variant creation tool called `cc-mirror`.

The file contains detailed release notes spanning from version 0.1.0 (2024-12-30) through version 1.4.2 (2025-01-05), organized chronologically with sections for Added, Changed, and Fixed improvements.

Key highlights include:

**Recent Updates (1.4.2):** Introduction of explicit model selection guidance across all documentation, with a framework categorizing Claude models as "haiku" for exploration tasks, "sonnet" for implementation work, and "opus" for critical analysis.

**Major Features (1.1.0+):** Implementation of Team Mode enabling multi-agent collaboration, introduction of a Mirror Claude provider with OAuth authentication, and development of a Multi-Agent Orchestrator skill with domain-specific reference guides.

**Earlier Releases:** Progressive feature additions including provider support (Z.ai, MiniMax, OpenRouter), theme customization, skill installation, and TUI improvements with dependency optimization.

The document uses standard changelog formatting with version numbers, dates, and categorized change descriptions, making it suitable for tracking software evolution and user communication about updates.
