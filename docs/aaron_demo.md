   [dev3] make a plan in specs/diagnostic_timing_SDLC.spec for setting up temporary repo in code4b/cxc_temp_repos/, doing     
  cxc_setup command, creating a series of issues with dependencies using mclaude team orchestration mode, then running        
  parallel and recording time everything takes to detect and diagnose unreasonable bottlenecks. include this instruction in   
  a <!-- md comment --> at the top verbatim. then execute it. Don't check in with me except up-front right now so I can walk  
   off

∴ Thinking…

  The user wants me to:
  1. Create a spec/plan for diagnostic timing of the SDLC
  2. Include the original instruction in an MD comment at the top
  3. Execute the plan
  4. Not check in with them - they want to walk away

  This is a significant task that I should plan and execute autonomously. Let me break it down:

  1. Create the spec file with the plan
  2. Set up a temporary repo in code4b/cxc_temp_repos/
  3. Run cxc setup
  4. Create test issues with dependencies
  5. Run parallel SDLC and time everything
  6. Analyze for bottlenecks

  Let me first create the spec, then execute it. I should ask one quick clarifying question if needed, but the user said to only 
  check in up-front right now.

  Actually, let me just proceed - the task is clear enough. I'll create the spec and execute it.
                                                                                                                             
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Quick clarification before you walk off: → (3) - and using only the MCP of course to check it's all there, identify 
     missing features / bugs.
     · How deep should the SDLC phases go? → Full SDLC ZTE -> fully autonomous orchestration

∴ Thinking…

  The user wants:
  1. Full stress test with 10+ issues
  2. Full SDLC ZTE (Zero Touch Execution) - fully autonomous
  3. Using only MCP tools to verify they all work and identify missing features/bugs

  This is a comprehensive test. Let me:
  1. Create the spec file with the plan
  2. Execute it autonomously
  3. Time everything
  4. Report bottlenecks and missing features

  I'll proceed without further check-ins.

⏺ Got it. 10+ issues, full ZTE via MCP, find bugs/bottlenecks. I'll run this autonomously and have a full report when you're back.
