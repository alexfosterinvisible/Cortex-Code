# CxC Framework Commands

This repo includes slash commands in two locations:

## Framework Commands (`commands/`)
Core CxC workflow commands used by the framework:
- `/implement` - Execute an implementation plan
- `/feature`, `/bug`, `/chore` - Planning templates
- `/classify_issue` - Classify GitHub issues
- `/review` - Review implementation against spec
- `/document` - Generate documentation
- `/commit`, `/pull_request` - Git operations

## Local Commands (`.claude/commands/`)
Project-specific commands:
- `/prime` - Read essential docs to understand CxC
- `/cxc-setup` - Setup CxC in a consuming project

## Usage
Use these commands with Claude Code CLI or in Cursor chat:
```
/prime
/implement specs/my-plan.md
```
